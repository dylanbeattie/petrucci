# The Rockstar Test Suite

The test suite is a set of Rockstar programs and their expected output.

It is completely implementation agnostic. To validate your own Rockstar implementation against the 
official test suite, run each Rockstar program in the suite and compare the output with the associated `.rock.out`
file.

For programs that read input from the console, your test harness should read input from the `.rock.in` file.
